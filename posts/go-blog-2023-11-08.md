# Starting over my first project in Go

## Battling over-excitement and scope creep

I'm a few weeks in now to learning Go and starting to build my first project - this blog site!

Things started out well. However, as I sometimes find when using a new technology for personal projects where the scope is not well defined, I've gotten carried away.

In the usual line of work, this would be identified as scope creep. I'm a little (read: a lot) less conscious of this when working on my own stuff.

I started out as a simple idea - create blog posts - has grown to a monstrosity of 11 database tables, 32 REST endpoints and 12 admin screens. Yet still, I haven't actually created a single post yet!

So, I'm taking it right back to the beginning. I'm going to start from the very basics and slowly build features on top of that.

The plan is to document the journey here. First up: [creating the database]().
